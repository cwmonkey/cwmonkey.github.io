layout: default
title: Bookmarklets - Clean Stream
---

<p>
	Drag the link to your shortcuts bar:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="javascript:(function(){url='//{{ site.domain }}/bookmarklets/clean-stream/bookmarklet.js';document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src=url+'?'+new Date().getTime();})();">Clean Stream</a>
</p>

<p>
	When you are on a page with a stream (or any flash player) click the bookmarklet and it will remove everything that is not a flash player from the page.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't work 100% of the time, but if it messes the page up all you have to do is refresh.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Update:</strong> Now works with the <a href="http://network.wwe.com/">WWE Network player</a>.
