	<h2><a href="#description">Usage and description</a></h2>
	<p>
		Install the Greasemonkey script below and take more control over your Slack experience.
	</p>

	<h3>What This Script Does</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Keeps threads open in right sidebar</li>
		<li>Keeps mentions open in right sidebar when no thread is open</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>TODO</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>"Reply in Thread" opens thread in Slack's native right sidebar (but this is faster, so maybe I need to incorporate the native sidebar in the main window somehow)</li>
		<li>Opening  thread in the right column can make it open in the main window as well if you move to that channel (could auto close)</li>
		<li>Opening threads is generally slow, would like to come up with a better way of doing it</li>
	</ul>
